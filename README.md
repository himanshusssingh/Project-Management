# Project-Manager

A web app to manage and track projects, tasks, users and reports.

---

## Overview

Project-Manager is a tool for teams to create, assign, and monitor projects and tasks, view reports, manage users, and gain insights. It enables role-based access control, dashboards, analytics, and a clean user experience for planning and execution.

The aim is to provide a robust yet flexible project management solution tailored to small & medium teams, with clear metrics, user stories, and extensible architecture (as laid out in the PRD).  

---

## Features

Some key features:

- Create, edit, and delete projects and tasks  
- Assign tasks to users  
- Status tracking (e.g. To Do, In Progress, Done)  
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Member)  
- Audit logs, activity tracking  

(Refer to PRD for the full list of functional requirements, priorities, and non-goals.)

## Architecture & Tech Stack

This project is structured using:

- **Backend**: [ Node.js + Express ]  
- **Database**: [ MongoDB ]  
- **Auth / Permissions**: e.g. JWT, role middleware  

It is designed to be modular, with separation of concerns (API, business logic, data access).
